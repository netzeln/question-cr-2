#### _The Ref Desk 2.0, {2016-04-08}_

#### By _**Nic Netzel (with special thanks to this week's pair coding partners, Jared, Yvonna and others)**_

## Description

_Users can enter a question they'd like answered, and allow the masses on the internet to give answers. Users can also give context for their question to help their non-profesional reference workers answer the question.  Other users can submit answers to questions, as well as provide a link to the site where they found the answer (because you know they probably just Googled it, and a URL is what passes for citation these days)_
